PROBLEM:
  The Federal Reserve maintains a list of financial institutions
  participating in the ACH network.  Write code which downloads
  their list of institutions, parses out the information, and
  stores it in a database.  The code only needs to support
  downloading and storing all of the entries.  Bonus points
  for using Ruby and writing tests.

  Download all entries:  http://www.fededirectory.frb.org/FedACHdir.txt
  Format Specification:  http://www.fededirectory.frb.org/format_ACH.cfm

Executing the Solution:

  1. cd into the application directory
  2. execute ./bin/retrieve_ach_network
